    """Takes a 2d slice of a 3d cell and projects it onto 2d coordinates.

    For simplicity in the documentation, we will assume that the cut is in the plane of
    the a and b lattice vector. We use Greek letter α and β to refer to the vectors in
    the 2d coordinate system. This routine computes the transformation Q such that

    .. math::

        \alpha &= Q a \\
        \beta  &= Q b

    Here, the matrix Q has a 2 × 3 shape so that the vectors α and β have only 2
    dimensions. Furthermore, we want that the matrix Q fulfills certain properties,
    namely that the lengths of the vectors and their angle is not changed. If the
    vectors lie within e.g. the x-y plane, α and β should be the same as a and b just
    with the zero for the z component removed. However, to avoid irregular behavior
    where small changes to the unit cell cause large changes to the selected vectors
    this mode only works if the normal vector is close (~15°) to a Cartesian axis.
    Otherwise the user needs to provide the axis with the *normal* argument.
    Alternatively, one can align the first remaining lattice vector with the x axis by
    passing None for *normal*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cell : np.ndarray
        A 3 × 3 array defining the three lattice vectors of the unit cell.
    cut : str
        Either "a", "b", or "c" to define which lattice vector is removed to get the slice.
    normal : str
        Set the Cartesian direction "x", "y", or "z" parallel to which the normal of
        the plane is rotated. Alteratively, set it to "auto" to rotate to the closest
        Cartesian axis. If you set it to None, the normal will not be considered and
        the first remaining lattice vector will be aligned with the x axis instead.

    Returns
    -------
    Plane
        A 2d representation of the plane with some information to transform data to it.
