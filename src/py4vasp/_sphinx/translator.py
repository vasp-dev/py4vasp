    """A docutils NodeVisitor that translates Sphinx document trees to Hugo-compatible Markdown.

    This translator implements the visitor pattern to traverse Sphinx document trees and convert
    them to Markdown format with Hugo front matter. The visitor pattern is used because it allows
    clean separation of the tree traversal logic from the conversion logic.

    Visit methods (visit_*) are called when entering a node during tree traversal. They are needed
    for every node type that requires special handling when first encountered. Use visit methods to:
    - Add opening markup (like opening tags or markdown syntax)
    - Initialize state for the current node
    - Add content that should appear before the node's children

    Depart methods (depart_*) are called when leaving a node after all its children have been
    processed. Add a depart method when you need to:
    - Add closing markup (like closing tags)
    - Clean up state after processing a node and its children
    - Add content that should appear after the node's children
    - Handle hierarchical structures where you need to track nesting levels

    Many simple nodes only need visit methods since Markdown doesn't require explicit closing
    for most constructs. The unknown_departure method handles cases where no specific depart
    method is defined.
