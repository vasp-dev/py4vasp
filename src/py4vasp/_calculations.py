class Calculations:
    """A class to handle multiple Calculations all at once.

    This class combines the functionality of the Calculation class for more than one
    calculation. Create a Calculations object using either a wildcard for a set of
    paths or files or pass in paths and files directly. Then you can access the
    properties of all calculations via the attributes of the object.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> calcs = Calculations.from_paths(calc1="path_to_calc1", calc2="path_to_calc2")
    >>> calcs.energies.read() # returns a dictionary with the energies of calc1 and calc2
    >>> calcs.forces.read()   # returns a dictionary with the forces of calc1 and calc2
    >>> calcs.stresses.read() # returns a dictionary with the stresses of calc1 and calc2

    Notes
    -----
    To create new instances, you should use the classmethod :meth:`from_paths` or
    :meth:`from_files`. This will ensure that the paths to your VASP calculations are
    properly set and all features work as intended. Note that this is an alpha version
    and the API might change in the future.
