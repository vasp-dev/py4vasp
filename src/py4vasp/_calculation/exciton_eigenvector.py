    The Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) accounts for electron-hole interactions
    involved in excitonic processes. For systems, where excitonic excitations
    matter the BSE method is an important tool. One can visualize excitonic
    contributions as so-called "fatbands" plots. Here, the width of the band is
    adjusted such that the band is wider the larger the contribution is. This
    approach helps understanding of the electronic transitions and excitonic
    behavior in materials.
