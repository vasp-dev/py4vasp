        {plane}

        For a collinear calculation, the magnetization density will be aligned with the
        y axis of the plane. For noncollinear calculations, the magnetization density
        is projected into the plane.

        Parameters
        ----------
        selection : Direction of the magnetic field for which the NMR current is read.
            If only a single direction is computed, it will default to that direction,
            otherwise to the "z" axis.

        {parameters}

        supercell : int or np.ndarray
            Replicate the contour plot periodically a given number of times. If you
            provide two different numbers, the resulting cell will be the two remaining
            lattice vectors multiplied by the specific number.

        Returns
        -------
        graph
            A quiver plot in the plane spanned by the 2 remaining lattice vectors.

        Examples
        --------

        Cut a plane at the origin of the third lattice vector.

        >>> calc.nmr_current.to_quiver(c=0)

        Replicate a plane in the middle of the second lattice vector 2 times in each
        direction.

        >>> calc.nmr_current.to_quiver(b=0.5, supercell=2)

        Take a slice along the first lattice vector and rotate it such that the normal
        of the plane aligns with the x axis.
