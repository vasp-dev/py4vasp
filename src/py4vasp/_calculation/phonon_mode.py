    A phonon mode represents a specific way in which atoms in a solid oscillate
    around their equilibrium positions. Each mode is characterized by a frequency
    and a displacement pattern that shows how atoms move relative to each other.
    Low-frequency modes correspond to long-wavelength vibrations, while
