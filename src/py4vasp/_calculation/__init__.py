class Calculation:
    """Provide refinement functions for a the raw data of a VASP calculation run in any directory.

    The :data:`~py4vasp.calculation` object always reads the VASP calculation from the current
    working directory. This class gives you a more fine grained control so that you
    can use a Python script or Jupyter notebook in a different folder or rename the
    files that VASP produces.

    To create a new instance, you should use the classmethod :meth:`from_path` or
    :meth:`from_file` and *not* the constructor. This will ensure that the path to
    your VASP calculation is properly set and all features work as intended.
    The two methods allow you to read VASP results from a specific folder other
    than the working directory or a nondefault file name.

    With the Calculation instance, you can access the quantities VASP computes via
    the attributes of the object. The attributes are the same provided by the
    :data:`~py4vasp.calculation` object. You can find links to how to use these quantities
    below.

    Examples
    --------

    Generate a new calculation object

    >>> calculation = Calculation.from_path("path/to/calculation")

    Plot the density of states (DOS) of a calculation

    >>> calculation.dos.plot()
    Graph(series=[Series(x=array(...), y=array(...), label='total', ...)],
        xlabel='Energy (eV)', ..., ylabel='DOS (1/eV)', ...)

    Read the energies for a structure relaxation run into a Python dictionary

    >>> calculation.energy[:].read()
    {'free energy    TOTEN': array(...), 'energy without entropy': array(...),
        'energy(sigma->0)': array(...)}

    Convert the structure to a POSCAR format

    >>> poscar_string = calculation.structure.to_POSCAR()

    def from_path(cls, path_name):
        """Set up a Calculation for a particular path and so that all files are opened there.

        py4vasp knows to which files the relevant information is written. It will
        automatically open the files as necessary and extract the required data from
        them. Then the raw data is refined according to the selected methods.

        Importantly, the creation of the Calculation object does not require that the
        VASP calculation was already finished. It does not even need the path to exist.
        All data is lazily loaded at the moment when it is needed. This also means that
        if you change the data, e.g. by rerunning VASP in the same path, py4vasp will
        directly read the new results. If you want to keep the old results, please run
        the new calculation in a new path.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path_name : str or pathlib.Path
            Name of the path associated with the calculation.

        Returns
        -------
        Calculation
            A calculation associated with the given path.

        Examples
        --------

        Create a new Calculation object from a specific path.

        >>> calculation = Calculation.from_path("path/to/calculation")

        You can also pass in pathlib Path objects or anything else that can be converted
        into it.

        >>> calculation = Calculation.from_path(pathlib.Path.cwd())
        """

        Typically this limits the amount of information, you have access to, so prefer
        creating the instance with the :meth:`from_path` if possible. Most data is
        found in the vaspout.h5 file, so if you renamed it for backup purposes most
        functions of py4vasp will work, when you pass it into this constructor.

        Please keep in mind that creating a new Calculation will not read any data.
        You can create an instance for a specific file and create or modify it
        afterwards. py4vasp access the data in the moment when it is needed e.g. to
        generate a plot or read it to a dictionary. However, this also means that you
        need to make sure to keep track of any changes, because the Calculation object
        is always a representation of the current contents of the file not the ones
        at creation of the Calculation object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file_name : str of pathlib.Path
            Name of the file from which the data is read.

        Returns
        -------
        Calculation
            A calculation accessing the data in the given file.

        Examples
        --------

        Create a new Calculation object to the vaspout.h5 file. For the most parts this
        is equivalent to the :meth:`from_path` method so you should typically use that
        instead.

        >>> calculation = Calculation.from_file("vaspout.h5")

        Sometime you rename the VASP output as a backup. Then the `from_file` constructor
        is your only option.

class DefaultCalculationFactory:

    current directory.

    Usually one is not directly interested in the raw data that is produced but
    wants to produce either a figure for a publication or some post-processing of
    the data. `calculation` contains multiple quantities that enable these kinds of
    workflows by extracting the relevant data from the HDF5 file and transforming
    them into an accessible format.

    Generally, all quantities provide a `read` function that extracts the data from the
    HDF5 file and puts it into a Python dictionary. Where it makes sense in addition
    a `plot` function is available that converts the data into a figure for Jupyter
    notebooks. In addition, data conversion routines `to_X` may be available
    transforming the data into another format or file, which may be useful to
    generate plots with tools other than Python. For the specifics, please refer to
    the documentation of the individual quantities.

    `calculation` reads the raw data from the current directory and from the default
    VASP output files. With the :class:`~py4vasp.Calculation` class, you can tailor
    the location of the files to your needs. Both have access to the same quantities,
    i.e., the two following examples are equivalent:

    .. rubric:: using :data:`~py4vasp.calculation` object

    >>> from py4vasp import calculation
    >>> calculation.dos.read()
    {'energies': array(...), 'total': array(...), 'fermi_energy': ...}

    .. rubric:: using :class:`~py4vasp.Calculation` class

    >>> from py4vasp import Calculation
    >>> calculation = Calculation.from_path(".")
    >>> calculation.dos.read()
    {'energies': array(...), 'total': array(...), 'fermi_energy': ...}

    In the latter example, you can change the path from which the data is extracted.
