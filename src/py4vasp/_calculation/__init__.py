"""Provide refinement functions for a the raw data of a VASP calculation run in the
current directory.

Usually one is not directly interested in the raw data that is produced but
wants to produce either a figure for a publication or some post-processing of
the data. This package contains multiple modules that enable these kinds of
workflows by extracting the relevant data from the HDF5 file and transforming
them into an accessible format. The modules also provide plotting functionality
to get a quick insight about the data, which can then be refined either within
python or a different tool to obtain publication-quality figures.

Generally, all modules provide a `read` function that extracts the data from the
HDF5 file and puts it into a Python dictionary. Where it makes sense in addition
a `plot` function is available that converts the data into a figure for Jupyter
notebooks. In addition, data conversion routines `to_X` may be available
transforming the data into another format or file, which may be useful to
generate plots with tools other than Python. For the specifics, please refer to
the documentation of the individual modules.

The raw data is read from the current directory. The :class:`~py4vasp.Calculation`
class provides a more flexible interface with which you can determine the source
directory or file for the VASP calculation manually. That class exposes functions
of the modules as methods of attributes, i.e., the two following examples are
equivalent:

.. rubric:: using :mod:`~py4vasp.calculation` module

>>> from py4vasp import calculation
>>> calculation.dos.read()

.. rubric:: using :class:`~py4vasp.Calculation` class

>>> from py4vasp import Calculation
>>> calc = Calculation.from_path(".")
>>> calc.dos.read()

In the latter example, you can change the path from which the data is extracted.

class Calculation:
    """Manage access to input and output of single VASP calculation.

    The :mod:`calculation` module always reads the VASP calculation from the current
    working directory. This class gives you a more fine grained control so that you
    can use a Python script or Jupyter notebook in a different folder or rename the
    files that VASP produces.

    To create a new instance, you should use the classmethod :meth:`from_path` or
    :meth:`from_file` and *not* the constructor. This will ensure that the path to
    your VASP calculation is properly set and all features work as intended.
    The two methods allow you to read VASP results from a specific folder other
    than the working directory or a nondefault file name.

    With the Calculation instance, you can access the quantities VASP computes via
    the attributes of the object. The attributes are the same provided by the
    :mod:`calculation` module. You can find links to how to use these quantities
    below.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> calc = Calculation.from_path("path_to_your_calculation")
    >>> calc.dos.plot()         # to plot the density of states
    >>> calc.magnetism.read()   # to read the magnetic moments
    >>> calc.structure.print()  # to print the structure in a POSCAR format
