class Calculation:
    """Provide refinement functions for a the raw data of a VASP calculation run in any directory.

    The :data:`~py4vasp.calculation` object always reads the VASP calculation from the current
    working directory. This class gives you a more fine grained control so that you
    can use a Python script or Jupyter notebook in a different folder or rename the
    files that VASP produces.

    To create a new instance, you should use the classmethod :meth:`from_path` or
    :meth:`from_file` and *not* the constructor. This will ensure that the path to
    your VASP calculation is properly set and all features work as intended.
    The two methods allow you to read VASP results from a specific folder other
    than the working directory or a nondefault file name.

    With the Calculation instance, you can access the quantities VASP computes via
    the attributes of the object. The attributes are the same provided by the
    :data:`~py4vasp.calculation` object. You can find links to how to use these quantities
    below.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> calc = Calculation.from_path("path_to_your_calculation")
    >>> calc.dos.plot()         # to plot the density of states
    >>> calc.magnetism.read()   # to read the magnetic moments

class DefaultCalculationFactory:
    """Provide refinement functions for a the raw data of a VASP calculation run in the
    current directory.

    Usually one is not directly interested in the raw data that is produced but
    wants to produce either a figure for a publication or some post-processing of
    the data. `calculation` contains multiple quantities that enable these kinds of
    workflows by extracting the relevant data from the HDF5 file and transforming
    them into an accessible format.

    Generally, all quantities provide a `read` function that extracts the data from the
    HDF5 file and puts it into a Python dictionary. Where it makes sense in addition
    a `plot` function is available that converts the data into a figure for Jupyter
    notebooks. In addition, data conversion routines `to_X` may be available
    transforming the data into another format or file, which may be useful to
    generate plots with tools other than Python. For the specifics, please refer to
    the documentation of the individual quantities.

    `calculation` reads the raw data from the current directory and from the default
    VASP output files. With the :class:`~py4vasp.Calculation` class, you can tailor
    the location of the files to your needs. Both have access to the same quantities,
    i.e., the two following examples are equivalent:

    .. rubric:: using :data:`~py4vasp.calculation` object

    >>> from py4vasp import calculation
    >>> calculation.dos.read()

    .. rubric:: using :class:`~py4vasp.Calculation` class

    >>> from py4vasp import Calculation
    >>> calc = Calculation.from_path(".")
    >>> calc.dos.read()

    In the latter example, you can change the path from which the data is extracted.
