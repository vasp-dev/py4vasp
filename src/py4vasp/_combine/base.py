class BaseCombine:
    """A class to handle multiple refinements all at once.

    This class combines the functionality of the refinement class for more than one
    refinement. Create a BaseCombine object using either a wildcard for a set of
    paths or files or pass in paths and files directly. Then you can access the
    properties of all refinements via the attributes of the object.

    Notes
    -----
    To create new instances, you should use the classmethod :meth:`from_paths` or
    :meth:`from_files`. This will ensure that the paths to your VASP calculations are
    properly set and all features work as intended. Note that this is an alpha version
    and the API might change in the future.
