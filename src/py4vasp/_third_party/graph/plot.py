def plot(*args, **kwargs):
    """Plot the given data, modifying the look with some optional arguments.

    The intent of this function is not to provide a full fledged plotting functionality
    but as a convenient wrapper around the objects used by py4vasp. This gives a
    similar look and feel for the tutorials and facilitates simple plots with a very
    minimal interface. Use a proper plotting library (e.g. matplotlib or plotly) to
    realize more advanced plots.

    Returns
    -------
    Graph
        A graph containing all given series and optional styles.

    Examples
    --------
    Plot simple x-y data with an optional label

    >>> plot(x, y, "label")

    Plot two series in the same graph

    >>> plot((x1, y1), (x2, y2))

    Attributes of the graph are modified by keyword arguments

    >>> plot(x, y, xlabel="xaxis", ylabel="yaxis")
