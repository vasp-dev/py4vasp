You need to specify a plane defined by two of the lattice vectors by selecting

should correspond to the fractional length along this third lattice vector.
py4vasp will then create a plane from the other two lattice vectors and
generate a contour plot within this plane.

Usually, the first remaining lattice vector is aligned with the x-axis and the
second one such that the angle between the vectors is preserved. You can
overwrite this choice by defining a normal direction. Then py4vasp will rotate
the normal vector of the plane to align with the specified direction. This is
particularly useful if the lattice vector you cut is aligned with a Cartesian
direction.

    You must select exactly one of these to specify which of the three lattice

    the fractional length along this lattice vector, so `a = 0.3` will remove
    the first lattice vector and then take the grid points at 30% of the length
    of the first vector in the b-c plane. The fractional height uses periodic
    boundary conditions.

supercell : int or np.ndarray
    Replicate the contour plot periodically a given number of times. If you
    provide two different numbers, the resulting cell will be the two remaining
    lattice vectors multiplied by the specific number.

normal : str or None
    If not set, py4vasp will align the first remaining lattice vector with the
    x-axis and the second one such that the angle between the lattice vectors
    is preserved. You can set it to "x", "y", or "z"; then py4vasp will rotate
    the plane in such a way that the normal direction aligns with the specified
    Cartesian axis. This may look better if the normal direction is close to a
