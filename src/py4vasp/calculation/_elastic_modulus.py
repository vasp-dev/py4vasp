    The elastic modulus, also known as the modulus of elasticity, is a measure of a
    material's stiffness and its ability to deform elastically in response to an
    applied force. It quantifies the ratio of stress (force per unit area) to strain
    (deformation) in a material within its elastic limit. You can use this class to
    extract the elastic modulus of a linear response calculation. There are two
    variants of the elastic modulus: (i) in the clamped-ion one, the cell is deformed
    but the ions are kept in their positions; (ii) in the relaxed-ion one the
    atoms are allowed to relax when the cell is deformed.
